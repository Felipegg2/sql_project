# 🚀 Project Name: SQL Project DVD Rental Store


## 😎 Developed by:

###[Felipe Gonzalez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipegzgc)


# 📜 Introduction


Greetings, tech enthusiasts and data lovers! Welcome ever.

PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database system, stands tall in this realm. This project is dedicated to exploring and practising some codes on PostgreSQL, understanding its tools, and harnessing its potential to generate accurate in sights and efficient analysis focusing on business vision.


# 💯 Objectives:

✔️ To explore the available tools to do analysis with PostgreSQL, like charts, tables, math and text functions developed in SQL.

✔️ To develop 10 queries on PostgreSQL with one .cvs database of DVD rental store. These queries seek to explain how the data is distributed and sorted into 15 different tables.

✔️ To share through a blog on GitHub the results of that process. How the queries were coded and if the results achieved support a right analytical position.

✔️ Enjoy data!


# 💻 Resources

🔨 pgAdmin 4 (version 7)
🔑 PostgreSQL (Version: 16)
🔧 GitHub Desktop and [Online Version.](https://github.com/)


# 📂 About Database

The database is property of PostgreSQLTutorial.com and it is available [here.](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip) It provides information about the business databases of a DVD rental store. It can be used for learning and practicing PostgreSQL.


The DVD rental database has many objects, including:

📍 15 tables
📍 1 trigger
📍 7 views 
📍 8 functions
📍 1 domain
📍 13 sequences


# 📋 Description:

Next, you find a short sketch for each query developed. What fields were used to develop each query, and some details like how the information was grouped and sorted. The description is linked with its folder respectfully. 

1️⃣ [QUERY 1:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%201) This query lists films, actors, rating, language and their length. It's ordering by length.

2️⃣[QUERY 2:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%202) This query shows the customer list with addresses, cities, countries and total amount of films rented. It's ordered descending.

3️⃣ [QUERY 3:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%203) This query shows how many films there are in the stores and the rental rate of each one.

4️⃣ [QUERY 4:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%204) This query shows how many films there are in each store. They are ordering descending by inventory available, title, length and store.

5️⃣ [QUERY 5:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%205) This query shows the films rented and returned. They are ordering by Title, last renting length, and inventory id.

6️⃣[QUERY 6:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%206) This query shows how the payments have been evolving throughout time.

**Note: On PostgreSQL you can get some _basic charts_. Hopefully, those graphs will help you to understand some data trends quickly. For instance, below you can check graphic representation of Query 6:**

![Payments evolving](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/assets/147356131/d5342e24-ae9b-4b2f-b2e6-793a798b2df7)


7️⃣ [QUERY 7:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%207) This query shows how many clients have been made some payment by city and country. Additionally, there has a column with the latest date when a payment was made.

8️⃣ [QUERY 8:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%208) This query shows the 100 films with the highest rental rate. They are ordering descending by rental rate, category and title.

9️⃣ [QUERY 9:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%209) This query shows how the films are distributed within special features and rating. It's ordered by number of films, special features and rating.

🔟 [QUERY 10:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%2010) This query shows a table grouped by how many actors there are in films and the number of films with the same number of actors.

# 📖 Conclusions

It is quite important to expand our knowledge and to integrate multiple data sources. This can add complexity and real-world relevance to the analysis. This project serves as a similar example of how SQL can transform data into actionable insights. The possibilities are limitless, uncover new stories hidden within the numbers. Nowadays, data is the new gold, and SQL is one of the keys to unlocking its value.

### Happy querying! 
### Keep learning, keep exploring, and keep innovating! See you soon.
