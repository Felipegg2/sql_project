# 🚀 Project Name:
SQL Project: DVD Rental Store


# 📜 Introduction


Greetings, tech enthusiasts and data lovers! Welcome ever.

PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database system, stands tall in this realm. This project is dedicated to exploring and practising some codes on PostgreSQL, understanding its tools, and harnessing its potential to generate accurate in sights and efficient analysis focusing on business vision.


# 💯 Objectives:

✔️ Explore the available tools to do analysis with PostgreSQL, like charts, tables, math and text functions developed in SQL.

✔️ Develop 10 queries on PostgreSQL with their .cvs file. These queries seek to explain how the data is distributed and sorted into 15 different tables.

✔️ Share through a blog on GitHub the results of that process. How the queries were coded and if the results achieved support a right analytical position.

✔️ Enjoy data!


# 📋 Description:

Next, you find a short sketch for each query developed. What attributes were used to achieved 

1️⃣       

1️⃣ [QUERY 1:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%201) This query lists films, actors, rating, language and their length. It's ordering by length.

2️⃣[QUERY 2:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%202) This query shows the customer list with addresses, cities, countries and total amount of films rented. It's ordered descending.

3️⃣ [QUERY 3:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%203) This query shows how many films there are in the stores and the rental rate of each one.

4️⃣ [QUERY 4:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%204) This query shows how many films there are in each store. They are ordering descending by inventory available, title, length and store.

5️⃣ [QUERY 5:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%205) This query shows the films rented and returned. They are ordering by Title, last renting length, and inventory id.

6️⃣[QUERY 6:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%206) This query shows how the payments have been evolving throughout time.
Note: On PostgreSQL you can get some basic charts. Hopefully, some graphs will help you to understand some data trends quickly. For instance, below you can check graphic representation of Query 6.

7️⃣ [QUERY 7:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%207) This query shows how many clients have been made some payment by city and country. Additionally, there has a column with the latest date when a payment was made.

8️⃣ [QUERY 8:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%208) This query shows the 100 films with the highest rental rate. They are ordering descending by rental rate, category and title.

9️⃣ [QUERY 9:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%209) This query shows how the films are distributed within special features and rating. It's ordered by number of films, special features and rating.

🔟 [QUERY 10:](https://github.com/Felipegg2/sql_project/tree/master/Query%210) This query shows a table grouped by how many actors there are in films and the number of films with the same number of actors.
