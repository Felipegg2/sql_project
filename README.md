# 🚀 Project Name:
SQL Project: DVD Rental Store


# 📜 Introduction


Greetings, tech enthusiasts and data lovers! Welcome ever.

PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database system, stands tall in this realm. This project is dedicated to exploring and practising some codes on PostgreSQL, understanding its tools, and harnessing its potential to generate accurate in sights and efficient analysis focusing on business vision.


# 💯 Objectives:

✔️ Explore the available tools to do analysis with PostgreSQL, like charts, tables, math and text functions developed in SQL.

✔️ Develop 10 queries on PostgreSQL with their .cvs file. These queries seek to explain how the data is distributed and sorted into 15 different tables.

✔️ Share through a blog on GitHub the results of that process. How the queries were coded and if the results achieved support a right analytical position.

✔️ Enjoy data!


# 📋 Description:

Next, you find a short sketch for each query developed. What attributes were used to achieved 


To kickstart our journey into the PostgreSQL universe, let's delve into a sample project using the PostgreSQL Sample Database. This project is a fantastic starting point to grasp the core concepts and functionalities of PostgreSQL. You can access the sample database and explore the project by following the link below:
